1. Explain what the simple List component does.

 The simple List component is a React component that takes an array of items as input and renders them as a list of items. Each item in the list is a clickable element that changes its background color based on whether it is selected or not.

2. The problems/warnings with the code are:

 -In the SingleListItem component, the onClickHandler prop is not being passed as a callback function. Instead, it is being called immediately with the index argument. This will result in the onClick event being triggered as soon as the component is rendered, rather than waiting for the user to click on the item.
 *The isSelected prop in the SingleListItem component is being passed a value of selectedIndex, which is a state variable set by the parent WrappedListComponent component.  However, isSelected is a boolean prop, and selectedIndex is a number. This will cause the background color of all list items to be green, as any non-zero number will be interpreted as true in a boolean context.
 +The items prop in the WrappedListComponent component is declared with PropTypes.array, but the correct syntax is PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape()). Also, the shape of each item should include the text property with the isRequired validator.

3. To fix the issue, code can be modified , and the modified code is there in **main** file.
